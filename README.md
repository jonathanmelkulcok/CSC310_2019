# CSC310_2019

This is a compilation of my homework assignments from my recent CSC 310 course.

HMW3:
This script manipulates the stack using a custom made method and can evaluate mathematical expressions.  I used some java utilities from some example code online to make the job easier and cleaner looking.

This program has a numeric based menu unlike the ones below, simply choose your option my entering the coresponding digit then foloow any future prompts if required.  Type any negative number on the menu to exit the app.

Current menu options:
Menu: (Press button to do action) 
1  to push int 				      //propts user to put a number on the stack when chosen
2  to pop top 				      //pops top value of stack set with option 1
3  display min. 			      //displays smallest value in the stack set with option 1
4  display top 				      //displays top of the stack set with option 1
5  to evaluate expression 	//prompts user to enter a mathematical equation with spaces in between each char then solves it
6  to evaluate postfix			//promts the user to enter an equation in postfix notation then solves it.
-1 to exit

HMW4:
Impliments several methods for queues and linked lists, basic main for testing.

test cases in order: basic circle queue methods
                     merging 2 queues
                     basic queue methods
                    
HMW5:
Impliments a recursive tower of hanoi algorith and a recusive in/pre order binary tree traversal

towerOfHanoi(# of discs, 'name of disk 1', 'name of disk 2', 'name of disk 3')

binary tree traversal has an example on how to setup, uses .left and .right to setup child nodes without setting values to null.

HMW6:
Impliments a priority queue system, and a corresponding sorting algorithm.  A heap sorting algorithm, and a basic minheap.

Heap sort and the queue operate off of given arrays.
